          JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily
          used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It enables
          client-side scripting, allowing developers to enhance user experiences
          by manipulating HTML, CSS, and handling events directly in the
          browser.

        <p class="description">
          Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function
          declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the
          compilation phase. This means you can use variables and functions
          before they are declared in the code, although only declarations are
          hoisted, not initializations.

          An accordion is a UI (User Interface) component used in web design
          that allows users to toggle between hiding and showing content. It's
          typically used to manage a large amount of content in a limited space
          by grouping it into sections or panels. Each section has a header
          that, when clicked, expands or collapses the associated content. This
          provides a cleaner, more organized way to display information without
          overwhelming the user with too much visible content at once.

          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used
          to create and structure content on the web. It defines the elements
          and structure of web pages by using tags to denote headings,
          paragraphs, links, images, and other content. HTML is the foundation
          of all web pages, enabling browsers to display text, images, and other
          elements in a structured manner.
